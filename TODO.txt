- Combinaciones for ORTHOGONAL ONLY---> E250, J501: 
Finnest only? -> YES.
Parameters, at all levels? --> yas
J501
---------------------------------------
E250
Gather
--------------------------------------
Code python matlab to automate error bars.

Gather all data, including, but not limited to:
- Gather Deflated Plain study.
- Gather data from single solves
- Gather data from small-physical

If(necessary)
    - Mirar E250 al 3er level -> deflation with 16 deflation Vectors
    - Deflation coarsest level E250 and J501. 64 deflation vectors.
endif


- #levels 
  - 2 3 lvls split ONLY
  - 2 3 lvls split ONLY + deflated coarsest w 64 test vectors

- Inexactly deflated Hutchinson: BPI tunning:  (J501 and E250) (Jump around to avoid all combinaitons)
    - rel-residual solves : 1E-1...1E-6 (Stop when not benneficial anymore)
    - # BPI iters: 1...5 (Stop when not benneficial anymore)

    
- Run with Z4
